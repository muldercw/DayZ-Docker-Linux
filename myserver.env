# Bind Mount overrides:
MOUNT_OVERRIDES=''
# EXAMPLES:
# Example mod config override, this would bind vppadmintools for sharing across multiple containers:
# MOUNT_OVERRIDES='- ./profiles/common/VPPAdminTools:/server/profile/VPPAdminTools'
# Another example config override, this would only bind the permissions directory, leaving all other options unique to every server:
# MOUNT_OVERRIDES='- ./profiles/common/VPPAdminTools/Permissions:/server/profile/VPPAdminTools/Permissions'
# Another example config override, this would only bind the superAdmins.txt file, leaving all other user options unique to every server:
# MOUNT_OVERRIDES='- ./profiles/common/VPPAdminTools/Permissions/SuperAdmins/SuperAdmins.txt:/server/profile/VPPAdminTools/Permissions/SuperAdmins/SuperAdmins.txt:ro'

# Multiple overrides can be declared by a new line (`), example:
# MOUNT_OVERRIDES='- ./profiles/common/VPPAdminTools:/server/profile/VPPAdminTools' `
